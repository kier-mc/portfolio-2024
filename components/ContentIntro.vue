    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Kieran, a web developer from the UK with strong front end skills but a
      good knowledge of how things work across the stack. I specialise in clean,
      responsive and accessible code, where the quality speaks for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love to build and will work on anything, as long as it contributes
      toward making the world a better place.
